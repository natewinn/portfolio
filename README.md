# Nate Winn - Portfolio
=======================

Hi, there!

My name is Nathan Winn, but you can just call me Nate. I recently finished a 3-month immersive coding bootcamp at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com) in Atlanta. Now, I can't stop thinking about code!

In this repo you'll find the insides of the latest iteration of my online portfolio. You can browse through the code here, but I would encourage you to check out the design at [nathanwinn.com](http://nathanwinn.com).

Connect with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/natewinn) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/natewinn) and let me know what you think!
