# My Personal Portfolio

Hi, there!

My name is Nathan Winn, but you can call me Nate. I recently finished a 3-month immersive coding bootcamp at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com) in Atlanta. Now, I can't stop thinking about code!

In this repo, you can take a "peek under the hood" of the latest iteration of my online portfolio. I would encourage you to not only browse through the code here, but check out the live site at [natewinn.com](http://natewinn.com).

Connect with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/natewinn) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/natewinn) and let me know what you think!

Cheers,
-Nate Winn
