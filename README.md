# My Personal Portfolio

Hi, there!

My name is Nathan Winn, but you can call me Nate. Iâ€™m a people person that loves tackling complicated problems with simple solutions. Which is what led me to my fascination with code!

In this repo, you can take a "peek under the hood" of the latest iteration of my online portfolio. I would encourage you to not only browse through the code here, but check out the live site at [natewinn.com](http://natewinn.com).

Connect with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/natewinn) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/natewinn) and let me know what you think!

Thanks,
Nate
